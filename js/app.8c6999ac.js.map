In the breeding season UK birds are to be found on the upland heather moorlands of Wales, Northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland (as well as the Isle of Man). In winter they move to lowland farmland, heathland, coastal marshes, fenland and river valleys. Those found in eastern and south-east England are probably mostly visitors from mainland Europe.\",\r\n        \"audio\": \"https://www.british-birdsongs.uk/sounds/753.mp3\",\r\n        \"features\": {\r\n            \"featherColor\": [\r\n                \"Black\",\r\n                \"Grey\",\r\n                \"White\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Beak\": [\r\n                \"Short\",\r\n                \"Hooked\",\r\n                \"Chunky\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"habitat\": [\r\n                \"Farmland\",\r\n                \"Grassland\",\r\n                \"Marine and intertidal\",\r\n                \"Upland\",\r\n                \"Wetland\"\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        \"monthsActive\": [\r\n            \"jan\",\r\n            \"feb\",\r\n            \"mar\",\r\n            \"apr\",\r\n            \"may\",\r\n            \"jun\",\r\n            \"jul\",\r\n            \"aug\",\r\n            \"sep\",\r\n            \"oct\",\r\n            \"nov\",\r\n            \"dec\"\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"Herring gull\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"Herring gull\",\r\n        \"scientificName\": \"Larus argentatus\",\r\n        \"images\": [\r\n            \"herring-gull_adult_1200x675.jpg\",\r\n            \"herring-gull_adult_inflight_1200x675.jpg\",\r\n            \"herring-gull_secondwinter_1200x675.jpg\",\r\n            \"herring-gull_juvenile_1200x675.jpg\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"family\": \"Gulls and terns\",\r\n        \"conservationStatus\": \"Red\",\r\n        \"protectedBy\": \"The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981\",\r\n        \"description\": \"Herring gulls are large, noisy gulls found throughout the year around our coasts and inland around rubbish tips, fields, large reservoirs and lakes, especially during winter.\",\r\n        \"diet\": \"Ominivorous- carrion, offal, seeds, fruits, young birds, eggs, small mammals, insects and fish. \",\r\n        \"length\": \"54-60cm\",\r\n        \"wingspan\": \"130-150cm\",\r\n        \"weight\": \"690-1440g\",\r\n        \"population\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"breeding\",\r\n            \"value\": \"140,000 pairs\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"found\": \"Herring gulls are widespread and can easily be seen at virtually any seaside town in the breeding season and inland all year round, especially at rubbish tips, playing fields and reservoir roosts.\",\r\n        \"audio\": \"https://www.british-birdsongs.uk/sounds/729.mp3\",\r\n        \"features\": {\r\n            \"featherColor\": [\r\n                \"Black\",\r\n                \"Grey\",\r\n                \"White\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Beak\": [\r\n                \"Regular\",\r\n                \"Powerful\",\r\n                \"Chunky\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"habitat\": [\r\n                \"Farmland\",\r\n                \"Grassland\",\r\n                \"Marine and intertidal\",\r\n                \"Urban and suburban\",\r\n                \"Wetland\"\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        \"monthsActive\": [\r\n            \"jan\",\r\n            \"feb\",\r\n            \"mar\",\r\n            \"apr\",\r\n            \"may\",\r\n            \"jun\",\r\n            \"jul\",\r\n            \"aug\",\r\n            \"sep\",\r\n            \"oct\",\r\n            \"nov\",\r\n            \"dec\"\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"Hobby\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"Hobby\",\r\n        \"scientificName\": \"Falco subbuteo\",\r\n        \"images\": [\r\n            \"hobby_1200x675.jpg\",\r\n            \"hobby_juvenile_1200x675.jpg\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"family\": \"Falcons\",\r\n        \"conservationStatus\": \"Green\",\r\n        \"protectedBy\": \"The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981\",\r\n        \"description\": \"About the size of a kestrel with long pointed wings, reminiscent of a giant swift.
