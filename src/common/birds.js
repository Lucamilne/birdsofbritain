It is mainly a resident breeder from southern England to northern Scotland, but is most numerous in Scotland and Wales. Many breeding birds are residents; in winter birds arrive here also from Europe.",

        "description": "The yellow-legged gull has only recently been recognised as a species in its own right, having previously been considered to be a race of herring gull. Adults have darker grey backs and wings than herring gulls, but are paler than lesser black-backed gulls. They have more black in the wing tips than herring gulls and smaller white 'mirrors'. The legs are bright yellow, there is a red ring around the eye and the bill is yellow with a large red spot. In non-breeding plumage, the head is less streaked and whiter than herring gulls. Juvenile yellow-legged gulls are very similar to juvenile lesser black-backed gulls, but tend to be whiter-headed and start to gain a grey 'saddle' on their backs quickly as they moult to first winter plumage. Immature birds gain adult-like characteristics as they mature over the course of five years with the legs turning yellow and dark grey feathers replacing the brown and black immature feathers.",

        "appearance": "Terns are small to medium birds, often smaller and slimmer than most of the gulls. All are migratory, often seen outside their breeding areas in spring and autumn, but absent from Europe in winter. There are two main groups, the ‘sea’ terns (not always strictly marine), which look pale grey and white except for a black cap in summer, have long tail streamers and dive to catch fish, and the ‘marsh terns’, which are blunt-tailed, almost black underneath in summer, and dip to pick their food from the surface without diving."

Many species nest in trees in mixed colonies, while bitterns are much more secretive and nest in dense reeds.",
        "appearance": "Spoonbills are characterised by their flattened bills with spatulate tips which are swept from side to side, partly open, through shallow water to detect food. The glossy ibis is an increasingly frequent stray from southern Europe. Ibises are somewhat heron-like but have shorter necks, rounder (often bare) heads and more slender, curved bills.

        "appearance": "They spend much of their time feeding on insects high in trees of coniferous and deciduous woodland meaning their high-pitch calls are often the easiest way to identify them. Incredibly, for such tiny birds, ringing has shown that goldcrests from Northern Europe and Scandinavia regularly migrate to the UK.

They are exceptionally agile fliers, with long, tapered wings and long tails, but they have very short legs and can scarcely walk. Their shape is similar to a kestrel or cuckoo.

        "appearance": "Their bills are curved and sharp, for extracting insect food and seeds from crevices in tree bark. One is a UK species, the other a very rare visitor from Europe; several other species are found worldwide. The two European treecreepers are exceptionally difficult to tell apart except by their calls and songs."

        "appearance": "In the UK, warblers can be separated into several groups – leaf warblers (slender, greenish birds of woodland and scrub, with simple soft call notes), reed, bush and grasshopper warblers (browner birds that live in wet places) and the Old World warblers (generally more patterned birds of woods and bushy places with short, hard call notes). Most are migrants but two species (plus increasing numbers of two others) remain in the UK in winter."

        "appearance": "Just one species breeds in Europe and visits the UK erratically in winter during 'irruption years'. Irruptions occur when population increases and shortages of food, particularly rowan berries, in its normal European range trigger large movements of birds to the south and west. One other species of waxwing normally found in North America has appeared in the UK on rare occasions."

Wrynecks are well-camouflaged, brown birds with shorter bills and normal tails."

        "appearance": "Wrens explore shady, overgrown places on or near the ground, for small insects and spiders. They are well known for their unusually loud, vibrant songs. Males make several nests, from which the female chooses one in which to lay her eggs. Only one species is found in Europe with many more in North America."
